For the products on home page I use some of the html and css from Featured products (to reuse the styling).

Some Issues:
1. I know that there will be some problems with the localization strings. 
2. I saw the logic for the adding to cart, rent and so on buttons (it's not very simple). 
	That's why I removed them.
	I can add them to, if it's necessary, but it will be some copy and pasting from ProductsFactory (why copy and pasting - because ProductsFactory and the models for it are in the main web project and reference it is a bad idea).
3. For the price it's the same as the buttons. There is a price but not with Discounts and so on.

If you see the plugin today Monday (12.03) and write back things you want to be done (from the above issues or any other) I'll try to do what I can after work (I don't promise much).
Well that's it. Hope you like the Plugin :).
